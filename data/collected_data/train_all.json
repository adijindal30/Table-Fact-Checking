    "Lender-level results - loan spreads and number of subsidiaries. This table reports results from lender-level regression of loan spread on the number of subsidiaries. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variable of interest is the natural logarithm and rank groupings of the number of subsidiaries. Included are loan controls for loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Using residuals from predicted number of subsidiaries. This table reports results from the prediction model of the number of subsidiaries and the second stage estimation of loan interest spread on the residuals from the prediction model. The dependent variable in the prediction model is the natural logarithm of the number of subsidiaries ( LogNumSubs ) and in the second stage is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variables of interest are residuals from the prediction model with industry fixed effects ( Residual1 ) and with firm fixed effects ( Residual2 ). Included are loan controls loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). The prediction includes two additional factors associated with the number of subsidiaries ( LogEmployees , RepatCost ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Alternative measures to the number of subsidiaries. This table reports results from an OLS regression of loan spread on alternative measures to the number of exhibit 21 subsidiaries. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variables of interest are the natural logarithm of the number of subsidiaries that borrow in the same year as the parent company ( LogTier1Subs , LogTier2Subs ) and the natural logarithm of the number of CEO or CFO in a firm's corporate family ( LogNumExecs ). Included are loan controls loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Effects of subsidiaries by location - domestic, foreign and Delaware. This table reports results from separate regressions of loan spread on the number of subsidiaries by location. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variables of interest are domestic subsidiaries ( LogDSubs ), foreign subsidiaries ( LogFSubs ), and domestic subsidiaries incorporated in Delaware ( LogDeSubs ). Included are loan controls loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Single and multi-segment firm-years. This table reports results from separate regressions of loan spread on the number of subsidiaries for firm-years with (i) single SIC vs multi-SIC and (ii) domestic sales only vs multinational firms. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variable of interest is the natural logarithm and rank groupings of the number of subsidiaries. Included are loan controls for loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Further evidence for the mechanism – equity ratio. This table reports results from an OLS regression of loan spread on equity ratio and the number of subsidiaries. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variables of interest are equity ratio ( EquityRatio ), natural logarithm of the number of subsidiaries ( LogNumSubs ), and the interaction between LogNumSubs * EquityRatio . Included are loan controls loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Selected non-price loan terms. This table reports results from separate regressions of individual loan terms on quintile groups of the number of subsidiaries. Each column header is the dependent variable. The variable of interest is the quartile group of the number of subsidiaries. Included are loan controls (excluding the term in the dependent variable) for loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Potential mechanism – minority interest. This table reports results from an OLS regression of loan spread on minority interest and the number of subsidiaries. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variables of interest are minority interest ( MinorityInt ), natural logarithm of the number of subsidiaries ( LogNumSubs ), and the interaction between LogNumSubs * MinorityInt . Included are loan controls loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."

    "Baseline results - loan spreads and number of subsidiaries. This table reports results from an OLS regression of loan spread on the number of subsidiaries. The dependent variable is the natural logarithm of loan spread ( LogSpread ). The variable of interest is the natural logarithm and rank groupings of the number of subsidiaries. Included are loan controls loan size ( LogLoanSize ), maturity ( LogMaturity ), covenants ( fCovenants ), loan provisions or restrictions ( Capex, PP_Indicator , PP_Rating , SecuredLoan , Sweeps , DividendR ), loan purpose ( TakeoverRecap , ShipAircraft , ComPaperBackup , CorpPurpose ), loan type ( TermLoan , CreditLine ), and loan syndication ( LogNumLenders , LogNumRptLenders , NumLeadLenders , ForeignLeadLender ). Also included are firm controls for firm size ( LogTotalAssets ), asset structure ( Tangibility ), profitability ( ROA ), leverage ( DebtRatio ), growth potential ( MarketToBook ), creditworthiness ( Zscore ), credit ratings ( Junkrated , Unrated ), external factors ( Big4Auditor , InstownHHI , Recession ), and diversification ( ForeignIncome , NumGeogSales , GeogSalesHHI , BussegSalesHHI ). See Table 1 for variable definitions. Robust t-statistics in parentheses are based on standard errors clustered by firm-year. ***, **, and * denote statistical significance at the 0.01, 0.05, and 0.10 levels, respectively."
